# Omnax
Omnax is meant to be a place where I build many of the components for modern Deep Learning whether it be LLM, diffusion, etc. from scratch in pure JaX. This is not meant to be a production grade system, but rather just the accumulation of my journey through AI. Why JaX? I heard its cool and performant. That's it! It also forces me to reinvent the wheel and make my own framework.
